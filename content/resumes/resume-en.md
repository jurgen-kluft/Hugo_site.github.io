### [**Shanghai Virtuos Software Co., Ltd. – Shanghai China**](http://www.virtuosgames.com/)
#### [Technical Director (Software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_director), 2005 to Present

Develop, maintain and support tools and systems for the infrastructure of projects, console and mobile platforms using C/C++, C# and related tools. Analyze code for system testing and debugging; create tests to find, isolate and rectify issues; create and use tools to find performance and memory isues and create solutions to optimize and reduce memory usage. Managing a team of 8 to 30 engineers.

Accomplishments:

* Reengineered multiple systems that fueled improvements to productivity, efficiency, responsiveness and maintainability. Developed code, system design and tests for many solutions, used tools and scripts to rollout updates.
* Led, architected and participated in the design, testing and deployment of a data building workflow, cross-platform tools, memory and profiling components.
* Developed modular, portable, thread-safe and ultra-high performance foundation and application infrastructure libraries.
* Trained and mentored junior, seniors and lead programmers in programming methodologies and best practices.
* Delivered an automation and data conversion tool set, enabling the company to be more efficient in handling this specific aspect from project to project.
* Developed a 'large binary data' management system enhancing [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)-[Hg](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) (a distributed version control system) that increased efficiency, availability and scalability tenfold.
* Made it a standard for every project to have a Continues Integration process to validate code and data changes. This later was advanced with automated testing, reporting and publishing of application builds.
* Introduced and helped integrating [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) into the company to manage medium to large projects using agile methods replacing the 'waterfall' mentality that only suited small projects.
* Handled and improved the recruitment and interviewing of software engineers from China and overseas. Supported HR with writing job descriptions for hiring open and new positions. Data analysis of the history of hired candidates to improve the efficiency and focus of our hiring efforts. Wrote C++ and C# test papers for HR to use to test candidates.
