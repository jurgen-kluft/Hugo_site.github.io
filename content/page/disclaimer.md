      As many personal views and opinions are detailed in this blog it is worth noting that opinions of people change over time
      and this is no less true for me. Anything I might say in a particular post has no bearing on how I might react or respond to a
      similar situation were it to occur again in the future. While I try and make this blog as accurate to my
      life as possible some things are deliberately left out or censored and as such my postings are not to be
      considered in any way a viable method for judging my character or suitableness for projects, tasks or employment
      and doing so will be considered an infringement of my rights.Where possible any infringement of my rights will be
      persued using applicable points of law.
